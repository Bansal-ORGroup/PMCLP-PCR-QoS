Each folder consists of 10 data samples. Each sample is denoted as "$x$Rec_ROIy_instancez" where x refers to the number of rectangular DZs, y reflects the radius of interest (ROI), and z referx to the sample number. For example, the "10Rec_ROI250_instance3" denotes the third sample with 10 rectangular DZs that are distributed with ROI 250 around each centerpoint in the 2D plane.
